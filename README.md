# Smart-Traffic-Light-System
An intelligent traffic control system using ESP32, ESP8266, and ESP32-CAM to optimize green light durations based on real-time vehicle density. The system uses a Flask-based machine learning server to analyze images from traffic lanes and coordinates multiple microcontrollers to manage traffic lights and countdown displays for up to four lanes.

Flask server with ML model to calculate dynamic green light durations

Master-slave communication between ESP32 and ESP8266 via UART

OLED displays show live countdown timers for each lane

Automatic traffic light control with feedback acknowledgment system
