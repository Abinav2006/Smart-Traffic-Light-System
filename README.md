# Smart-Traffic-Light-System
An intelligent traffic control system using ESP32, ESP8266, and ESP32-CAM to optimize green light durations based on real-time vehicle density. The system uses a Flask-based machine learning server to analyze images from traffic lanes and coordinates multiple microcontrollers to manage traffic lights and countdown displays for up to four lanes.
